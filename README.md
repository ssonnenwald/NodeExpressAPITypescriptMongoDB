# Node Express API Typescript MongoDB

## General

A Node Express API in Typescript with the MongoDB.

## Initial Note

I will write more documentation about the project, but this is a VSCode project done in Typescript.  It is a NodeJS Express Web API using HTTPS.  I have done it in typescript instead of just javascript.  I have added swagger(openapi 3.0.1) to it.  I have also commented it and run TypeDoc on the project and the code documentation is generated in the docs folder.  The API uses the community version of MongoDB.

## What does the API do

This API is an example I made to demostrate CRUD operation using a very simple contact object.  So it will create new contact, update a contact, delete a contact and list the contacts.  Best way to understand the API is run the API and view the swagger documentation (<https://localhost:3000/swaggerui/).>
